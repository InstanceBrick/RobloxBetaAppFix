# BROKEN! roblox patched this method sadly, i'll try to find a new bypass soon!
Disable Beta App/RobloxBetaAppFix/Remove Roblox Beta App

New roblox beta app messing up VR and all that so I quickly threw this together lol

Big thanks to pobammer his solution is here - https://gist.github.com/howmanysmall/1f34b6df3ae5f344d78ef996f8b4efda

I just compiled it into a EXE to make it easier along with some of my own added on features.

Current features (v1.0.5)
- Custom Context Menu (System Tray)
- Fixed Roblox crashing upon leave
- Returns roblox back to browser state and removes that damn app (ofc lol)
- Auto Updater (if you download that EXE)
- Shows how many instances of Roblox are Open (Context menu)
- Kill Roblox option (Context Menu)
- VERY low CPU usage (Task manager says 0% lol)

I will continue to post updates in the releases if you dont want to download the auto updater (but it is recommended as I only upload stable versions of the application.)
